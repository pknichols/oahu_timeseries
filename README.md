# Raw metabarcoding sequence data and metadata for O'ahu timeseries study


Nichols PK & Marko PB (_in prep._). Spatial complexity, not temporal noise, structures eDNA community profiles on coral reefs.  

This repository contains VSEARCH command line codes and R scripts for the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding sequence data. The dataset includes:

* VSEARCH.text - command line codes for processing of raw metabarcoding seuquence data
* 1_Preprocessing18S.Rmd - R markdown file for INSECT taxonomy classification and decontamination of 18S data
* 2_18S.Rmd - R markdown file for taxon filtering, read normalization, community and statistical analyses related to 18S dataset
* 3_PreprocessingCOI.Rmd - R markdown file for INSECT taxonomy classification and decontamination of COI data
* 4_COI.Rmd - R markdown file for taxon filtering, read normalization, community and statistical analyses related to COI dataset
* 5_CombinedAnalyses.Rmd - R markdown file for producing figures and combined analyses on outputs from both 18S and COI datasets

Raw metabarcoding sequences have been submitted to NCBI SRA (BioProject PRJNA1399417). https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA1399417?reviewer=u0i7n07faajchu46geulelke46
